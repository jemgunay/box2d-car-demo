# Go Box2D Car Demo

A port of a top-down car demo written in JS (http://domasx2.github.io/gamejs-box2d-car-example/) to Go, using the pixel game package and ByteArena's Go box2D port.

- W to accelerate
- S to break
- A/D to steer
- Q to toggle gear between forwards/backwards

## TODO

- Destroy car when health == 0 (detach wheels)
- Collide wheels with wall/crate but not car
